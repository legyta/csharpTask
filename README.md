#Extra info and explanation on future scalability

The current code only deals with the test data in XML file.
In the future, the new Class named Department could be added, which deals with the incoming data. It can be coming in from another XML file/database etc. 
This way, there would be no hard-coded values for department names, and it would be possible to add new rules for adding/removing departments without changing the code.

Line 9 in code shows an example of how that data could be Read. 

#Extra files

I am adding 2 photos, to display the logic of how the data flow should happen for the code and loop.
Also, image to display the data flow for the project.
